# Timesheet_csoptima

## Timesheet Frontend

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript frontend scaffold for the Timesheet project. It's intentionally minimal so the backend can be connected later via an environment variable `VITE_API_BASE`.

How to run:

1. npm install
2. npm run dev

Notes

- This repository contains the frontend code for the Timesheet project.
- The dashboard UI was updated to remove mini-sparklines and add an AreaChart; local persistence uses localStorage/sessionStorage for demo data.

This project was scaffolded and iteratively updated while pairing with a developer assistant as a starting point.
